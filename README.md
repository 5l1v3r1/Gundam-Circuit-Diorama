# Gundam-Circuit-Diorama

Hi Greetings! I want to share with the community a simple low-cost project to create dioramas with gundam models, breadboards, cables and little else.
The following project does not require Arduino or other Boards and is of simple construction, with a pretty good result ...

It works both with 9v batteries and with normal 5v power supplies (those for smartphones or for old symbian phones are just fine)
